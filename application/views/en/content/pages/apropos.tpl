<h2>The Author</h2>
<p>J. P. Savard has been a professional web programmer since he was 12 years old. He sees the Web page as an art and dreams of offering humankind a multimedia experience out of the ordinary. Inspired by such works as <em>Homestuck</em>, <em>In a Galaxy near you</em> or <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em>, <em>My Little Pony</em> as well as <em>Wikipedia</em>, he creates on a day of spring 2012 the world of Zarmina based on the Wikipedia page of the planet in question and an excess of imagination and dream.</p>
