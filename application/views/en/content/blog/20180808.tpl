There you go, new website. I hope you like it. This time, a kind of webnovel updated like a webcomic. That I hope I will update more regularly.

Zarmina has changed shape many times during its development, many ideas abandoned and recycled. Last time it was a kind of webcomic at the MS Paint Adventures, but I was always terrible in drawing, I could not give you a quality product, so I changed the idea a bit. Why not some kind of visual novel? I wanted to give you an original product in an original format, but it's always hard to find one that works, that was not too ambitious and that I had the time and motivation to do.

Finally, I started to rewrite the project in the form of a standard novel. Less need to illustrate it, which was my original goal but was the thing that slowed me down, so I put that aside (but that does not mean there will be illustrations somewhere), and I can give a lot more details about the story in this form. It will also be easier to adapt it in another form later, who knows?

The first chapter <a href="<!--{$url_lang}-->chapitre/1">is online</a>, the first four chapters or so will be a rather direct adaptation of the script that I wrote for the first chapter of a visual novel, an audio series or something, you will probably recognize if you followed <a href="http://old.zarmina.xyz">Zarmina version 1</a>. üòÅ The site is a little empty, but more stuff will come with the next chapters soon, on this, good reading!
